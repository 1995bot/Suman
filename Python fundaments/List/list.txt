In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [],
 separated by commas.

 A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.)

 Integer = +ve and -ve numbers are known as integer

 float = Number Which usually has a decimal point

 String = check other floders boiiiii

 Nested list : A list can also have another list as an item. 
 eg: check listexamples.py


YOU CANNOT INDEX LIST WITH FLOATS.
